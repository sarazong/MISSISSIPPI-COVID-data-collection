# MISSISSIPPI-COVID-data-collection
I am collecting daily COVID data for the different counties in MISSISSIPPI for a COVID internship. The state public health department of Missisipi updates their COVID case counts everyday in a PDF. It contains information for each county by race and ethnicity (intersection). However, data is desired to be separatedly recorded as by race and by ethnicity instead. Since the data needs to be collected daily, doing the arithmetic manually means spending about an hour everyday when a computer can do this in a few seconds. I think it is a good idea to keep myself "DRY" from an hour of "sweat" by writing a function to do the work.
